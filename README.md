## Paul Millen

I am about to compelete Makers Academy - a web development bootcamp that emphasises clean code using TDD, OOD and SOLID principals.  Previously, I provided business and accounting support to London tech startups at the forerunning specialists in the sector, iHorizon.  Prior to *that* I was a freelancer in the theatre and film industry.  I production managed touring theatre, created sounds and music as a theatre sound designer and swung the boom on the sets of commercials, TV and big budget movies.  I'm now looking to tackle creative and technical challenges as a junior developer.    

## Skills

#### Fast, Independent Learner

In twelve weeks at Makers Academy I have developed a solid foundation knowlege of the full stack, XP principals and TDD.  I have been required to learn languages and frameworks in short periods of time:
- [Instagram clone](fstop-pm.herokuapp.com), after one week of learning Rails.
- [SPA Note app](http://notes-pm.herokuapp.com/), after one week of learning Javascript.
I am excited to discover new technologies and I made a point of pushing myself beyond the requirements of the course, for example, learning and implementing Bootstrap 4 on the above projects, ES6, or opting as part of a group project to experiment with Express.  It has been a joy, as a bit of an auto-didact, to see so much emphasis on independent learning on this course, and in the field of programming and development. 

#### Communication

Throughout my career it has been a requirement to effectively communicate between the technical and non-technical, whether tailoring financial reports, explaining technical accounting points to founders or negotiating the competing interests on theatre and film projects.  

As a facet of XP, I believe effective listening is key to good communication.  Colleagues have been kind enough to say that I am an approachable and calming presence and I've always formed great relationships with my clients and colleagues as an accountant and a freelancer - for which your reputation secures your next job.  I was awarded "team player of the year" when I took a year out to work for St Christopher's Fellowship as a support worker for homeless young people in Shephards Bush. Training and working as a volunteer counsellor for Childline has also allowed me to develop my active listening skills.   

#### Problem-solving

My time as a freelancer has been an intensive preparation for the challenges of life as a developer.  I have learned how to methodically approach problems and resolve them creatively with limited time and resources.

In 2012-13, I production managed the highliy acclaimed touring theatre project, *Ring*, for FUEL theatre.  This had a very specific set of technical requirements that had to be adapted to each venue.  It was my job to make this happen, managing each new team of technicians and house staff.

As a sound recordist, I was typically solely responsible for the capture of dialogue on film and TV projects.  Filming locations are not usually chosen with sound in mind, so employing my technical knowledge of acoustics to spot and fix issues before they effect the schedule were a feature of every job.
