## Paul Millen -- First Draft

I am currently a student at one of the most discerning dev bootcamps in the world.  Previously, I provided business and accounting support to London tech startups at the forerunning specialists in the sector, iHorizon.  Prior to *that* I was a freelancer in the theatre and film industry.  I production managed touring theatre, ran creative projects as a theatre sound designer and swung the boom on the sets of commercials, TV and big budget movies.  I'm now looking to tackle creative and technical challenges as a junior developer.    

## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my career it has been a requirement to effectively communicate between the technical and non-technical, whether tailoring financial reports, explaining technical accounting points to founders or negotiating the competing interests on theatre and film projects.  

I believe effective listening is key to good communication; people often observe that I am an approachable and calming presence - I've always had great relationships with my clients and colleagues as an accountant, and as a freelancer where your reputation secures your next job.  I was awarded "team player of the year" when I took a year out to work for St Christopher's Fellowship at a hostel for homeless young people in Shephards Bush. Training and working as a volunteer counsellor for Childline has also allowed me to further develop my active listening skills.   

#### Problem-solving

My time as a freelancer has been an intensive preparation for the challenges of life as a developer.  I have learned how to methodically approach problems and resolve them creatively with limited time and resources.

I production managed a highliy acclaimed touring theatre project, *Ring*, for FUEL theatre.  This had a very specific set of technical requirements that had to be adapted to each venue.  It was my job to make this happen, managing each new team of technicians and house staff.

As a sound recordist, I was typically solely responsible for the capture of dialogue on film and TV projects.  Filming locations are not usually chosen with sound in mind, so employing my technical knowledge of acoustics to spot and fix issues before they effect the schedule were a feature of every job.
